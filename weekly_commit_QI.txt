Weekly Commit

This week we talked about activity selection.

We put forth 5 activity: Finite State Automata, Searching Algorithms, Sorting Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, Minimal Spanning Trees.

Then we went into details of implementation for all of the five activities, just to see which one is more interesting and easy to realise.

Next day we had a face-to-face meeting and decided that Finite State Automata will be our activity. We also assigned the XP core value to each of the team members. Mine is Simplicity.
